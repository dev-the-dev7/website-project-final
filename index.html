			<h2>Characters Confirmed</h2>

				<hr>
				<p class="centertext">That's right, every character that as ever been in the Smash Bros. series is back. No one's favorite character will be cut this time
				around, including even young Link and Pichu. Now, let us talk about the most exciting thing about Smash Bros., the newcomers. Though only two characters have
				been confirmed so far, they are among the most requested ones. Inkling was the first one announced the same time the game was revealed, along with the long
				time requested character, Ridley.</p>

				<hr>
				<p class="centertext">Since we have gotten all character to return this time around, many people were wondering about the stages. Although not all stages
				will be returning, most of them will, along with brand new stages. So far, they seem to be based on games released on the Nintendo Switch. Two of the new
				stages they showed off were the Great Plateau Tower from the Legend of Zelda and Moray Towers from Splatoon.</p>

				Krystal, Knuckles, the squid sisters, Samurai Goroh, Waluigi(sadly), and Bomberman. Though your favorite character might not make the roster, you can still
