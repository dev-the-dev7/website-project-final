						<h1>Possible Newcomers</h1>
						<img src="./assets/Waluigi2.png" alt="Waluigi">
						<p>Here we discuss the possible newcomers with the best chances of ending up in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. We do a brief assessment based on
						the character's pros and cons, along with their popularity, to see which one has the best chance.</p>

					<h3>Paper Mario</h3>
					<img src="./assets/papermario.png" alt="Paper Mario" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Mario has been one of the series that has had the most representation throughout Smash. Now having eight characters after they announced Daisy as
						a newcomer in Smash Ultimate. And that's only if you don't count the Yoshi and Wario characters, which originate from the Mario series. Still,
						people are itching to see a new Mario rep and among the top picks is Paper Mario. The Paper Mario series is definitely one of the most beloved Mario
						spin-offs. He is a pretty popular character, and I wouldn't be surprised if he showed up.</p>

					<h3>Caption Toad</h3>
					<img src="./assets/captiontoad.png" alt="Caption Toad" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Another top pick is Caption Toad. Having been in four Mario games since Mario Galaxy and staring in his own spin-off game, he is definitely a very
						relevant character from the Mario series. The main problem keeping Caption Toad from becoming a playable character in Smash is his move set. Since he
						can't jump, it would be hard to add him as jumping is pretty much necessary in Smash. I'm sure they could find a way around it, but it
						would just take much more work than other fighters.</p>

					<h3>Geno</h3>
					<img src="./assets/geno.png" alt="Geno" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">	
						<p>Geno, a fan favorite character requested since Melee, probability has the best chance of making it in from the Mario series. Not only does he have
						a large amount of the popular vote, but he was also intended to be in Super Smash Bros. Melee but was cut due to time constraints. He was also made
						into a costume in Smash Bros. 4. I would be a little surprised not to see him appear in the new game.</p>

					<h3>Skull kid</h3>
					<img src="./assets/skullkid.png" alt="Skull Kid" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Skull Kid has been one of the most requested players since the release of Majora's Mask in 2000. Things didn't look good for his chances for
						a while. However, ever since the game was remastered on the 3DS in 2015, popularity has risen once again, allowing Skull Kid to have a great chance
						at making the fighter roster.</p>

					<h3>Mask Link</h3>
					<img src="./assets/masklink.png" alt="Mask Link" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>This is definitely a unique character that has garnered a decent amount of popularity and would definitely be an entertaining character to play.
						However, now that young Link is back, that would make four different Links. Not only that, but they are kind of the same character just with
						different abilities. I believe, at most, we will see young Link transform into Fierce Deity Link as a final smash, and that's about it.</p>

					<h3>Impa</h3>
					<img src="./assets/impa.png" alt="Impa" width="160px" height="165px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Impa has been a character that has seemed to have gotten into popularity recently. She is a very significant character from the series and would
						fit into Smash Bros. really well. Especially, now that they are talking about clone characters, I believe Impa would be an excellent clone fighter
						for Sheik.</p>
						<h4>Popularity: 65%</h4>

					<h3>Wolf Link</h3>
					<img src="./assets/wolflink.png" alt="Wolf Link" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Wolf Link is definitely a popular requested character from the Zelda series, representing the Twilight Princess game. The main problem is that
						Midna has already been confirmed as an assist trophy, meaning she can't fight with Wolf Link. This lowers his chances drastically because he
						just isn't the character most people would want for Smash Bros. anymore without Midna.</p>
						<h4>Popularity: 60%</h4>
						<div class="progress-bar">
							<span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 60%;"></span>

					<h3>Toon Zelda</h3>
					<img src="./assets/toonzelda.png" alt="Toon Zelda" width="150px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Though she was initially planned to appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee back in the day, her relevance has dropped drastically since then. There
						are much better characters to pick from the Zelda series, and I don't see anyone getting too excited over her inclusion. However, since she
						was planned to be in the game at one point and would make a good clone character for Zelda, I believe she still has a slight chance to make the
						roster.</p>

					<h3>King K. Rool</h3>
					<img src="./assets/kingkrool.png" alt="King K. Rool" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Probably the most likely character to make the roster being the most popular character right now. He's been at the top of any smash bros.
						poll you can find on the internet thought to have even won the official Smash Bros. Fighter Ballot. He fits so many roles we are lacking in Smash
						Bros. at the moment, such as villain and heavyweight fighters, and has even gotten a costume in Smash Bros. 4. I would be pretty surprised to not see
						him make the roster.</p>

					<h3>Dixie Kong</h3>
					<img src="./assets/dixiekong.png" alt="Dixie Kong" width="130px" height="140px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Dixie Kong is also a very popular character that would fill multiple character types as well. She would provide another female representative
						along with a new Donkey Kong rep, which we haven't since Brawl. Due to all the things she brings and her significance in the series, she has a
						great chance to become a new fighter.</p>

					<h3>Cranky Kong</h3>
					<img src="./assets/crankykong.png" alt="Cranky Kong" width="145px" height="145px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Though this character has a fair amount of importance in the games and would make a decent playable character, I just don't see them putting
						him in. First off, he just isn't that desired by fans and is a little forgettable. I also don't see them putting in three playable
						characters from the Donkey Kong series in one game. I feel he will be a commonly requested character in the future, but for now, I don't think
						so.</p>

					<h3>Funky Kong</h3>
					<img src="./assets/funkykong.png" alt="Funky Kong" width="180px" height="205px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>This character has probably the least importance in the game compared to the others. However, since they are focusing on clone fighters and he has
						had a surge in relevance from the remake of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, he as a small shot at making it into the new Smash Bros. game.</p>

					<h3>Decidueye</h3>
					<img src="./assets/decidueye.png" alt="Decidueye" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Decidueye is one of the most popular Pokémon to come out of Sun and Moon and is highly requested by Smash fans. People initially wanted him to
						fill out the fire/water/grass starters that Pokémon is known for, but then they switched Charizard, the fire starter in Smash, from being his own
						character back to being a part of Pokémon Trainer. However, fans still see him as a great addition to the Smash roster and would love to see him
						make it in the game.</p>

					<h3>Tapu Koko</h3>
					<img src="./assets/tapukoko.png" alt="Tapu Koko" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Legendary Pokémon are one of the most significant parts of Pokémon games, and are the most recognizable and liked Pokémon in the series. Not only
						that, but we haven't had a new legendary Pokémon in a while. Since Sun and Moon are the most current games and are the most relevant, it will
						probably be a legendary from there. The one that I believe is the most qualified legendary from Sun and Moon is Tapu Koko. He is the most relevant of
						the legendries with the most screen time and seems to fit into Super Smash Bros. the best.</p>

					<h3>New Pokémon</h3>
					<img src="./assets/unknown.png" alt="Question Mark" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>Usually, Super Smash Bros. likes to show off the latest Pokémon in their games. With a new generation of Pokémon right around the corner I feel we
						might be getting a new Pokémon that we never seen before just like the situation with Greninja we had in the last game. Granted the game is a little
						farther away this time around, I feel there could still be a good chance we get a new Pokémon.</p>

					<img src="./assets/bandanadee.png" alt="Bandana Dee" width="160px" height="160px" class="emblem-floatleft">
					<div class="rightalign">
						<p>This is another prevalent character that is kind of a no brainer for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. For the past couple of games, he's been a pretty
						significant character. Usually being the 4th playable character in multiplayer Kirby games. We have the other three in Smash Bros. already. The only
						one left is Bandana Dee. Plus, it would be interesting to see a fighter with a spear.</p>

						<p>This character is pretty low on the popular side, being just an occasional minor character in the series. However, since Nintendo has been
						emphasizing clone fighters, I believe he has a shot. He has a very slick design and would be a perfect clone fighter for Meta Knight. After Bandana
						Dee, I think this character has the best chance to make it in.</p>

						<p>Yes, Ridley is finally confirmed to be coming to Super Smash Bros. He has been a fan request for a long time. Back in the day, he was one of the
						most popular requests, but as of late, people have been doubting that he would ever make it do to the creator of Smash Bros., saying he was too big

						<p>Dark Samus has always been a popular pick ever since we were told that Ridley was too big to become a playable character. Now that they are

						<p>Some people really want to see a new F-Zero rep as Caption Falcon has been the only representative from the series since the first Smash Bros.
						game came out almost 20 years ago. The main problem with adding a new representative would be the moveset. Like Caption Falcon, the moveset would
						have to be totally original due to F-Zero being a racing series. At this point, I believe Black shadow is the only F-Zero character that has any
						chance of making it into the roster as he seems like the best fit.</p>
